## General info
This is a Discord bot i created for the [Cartel Custonms][CCDiscord] discord server. 
I've been workingon this bot for months and spent 200+ hours.
Im moving on so i wanted to share the entire source code so other people can learn from it. 
I don't claim that the code is anywhere near perfect as this was a huge learning curve for me.
All licenses apply.  Keep in mind the code might not be the best as this was my first good Discord Bot 
and the first project ever i made in Java.  
All bot tokens have been reset and all passwords changed for security purposes.
